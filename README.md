# CalendarAndroidApp

# How to run
To use the product you need to run the folder CalendarMobileApp through an emulator of an Android device that has API 33 (at least) or install the apk file onto a device with Android operating system (with at least API 33). If you choose the option to run it using an emulator, I recommend doing it through Android Studio as it provides a required emulator and it is possible to view the code!
